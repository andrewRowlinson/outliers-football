# Identify young outliers in the top-5 leagues
Recruitment is one of the most important use cases for football analytics. One commonly used method is to identify similar players. Another side of the coin is to identify players that are the most different from other players (known as outliers).

In this repository we aim to identify players that are:
- aged 24 or under
- played at least 810 minutes
- are outliers in the data, e.g. they have a high number of expected goals compared to other players
